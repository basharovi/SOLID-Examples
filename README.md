# SOLID-Examples
S.O.L.I.D is an acronym that represents five principles of object-oriented programming and code design theorized by our beloved Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin) by the year 2000. The author Michael Feathers was responsible for creating the acronym:

- [x] S – Single Responsibility (SRP)
- [x] O – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- [x] L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- [x] I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- [x] D – Dependency Inversion (DIP)
