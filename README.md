# SOLID-Examples
S.O.L.I.D is an acronym that represents five principles of object-oriented programming and code design theorized by our beloved Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin) by the year 2000. The author Michael Feathers was responsible for creating the acronym:

- [x] S – [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](https://github.com/basharovi/SOLID-Examples/tree/main/SingleResponsibilityPrinciple)
- [x] O – [Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](https://github.com/basharovi/SOLID-Examples/tree/main/OpenClosedPrinciple)
- [x] L – [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](https://github.com/basharovi/SOLID-Examples/tree/main/LiskovSubsitutionPrinciple)
- [x] I – [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](https://github.com/basharovi/SOLID-Examples/tree/main/InterfaceSegregationPrinciple)
- [x] D – [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](https://github.com/basharovi/SOLID-Examples/tree/main/DependencyInversionPrinciple)
